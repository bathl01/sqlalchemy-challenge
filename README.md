Module 10 Challenge #
climate analysis about Honolulu, Hawaii in preparation for a long holiday.
# Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, youâ€™ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
# Part 2: Design Your Climate App
Climate App is still a bit clunky due to running it requires copying each section to the url buttons would be better but beyond my level at this point.
